# PolkaName

## Overview 

PNS (Polkadot Name Service) is a smart contract-based domain name system on the Polkadot blockchain that allows users to create decentralized domain names. A supported wallet can then allow senders to enter PNS domain names instead of long and unwieldy addresses. This prevents phishing, fraud, typos, and adds a layer of usability on top of the regular wallet user experience. On Polkadot's blockchain, the PNS system has multi-chain support, enabling users to deeply integrate into Polkadot's ecosystem by adding KSM and DOT addresses to the PNS, providing a strong backbone for Web3 applications. Each domain name can also be traded and circulated as NFT at the same time. PNS can realize the identity readability of Polkadot's ecosystem and cooperate with litentry's identity aggregation to realize a superb user experience identity system.PNS domain names essentially follow the NFT protocol and can be auctioned and traded, and a decentralized domain name service provider can be realized through Polkadot's governance module. 

The goal of PNS is similar to the Internet's domain name service DNS. Like DNS, PNS operates on a point-separated hierarchical name system called domain names, where the owner of the domain name has full control over the subdomains. Top-level domains, such as '.polka' and '.dot', are owned by smart contracts that set out the rules governing the assignment of their subdomains. Anyone who abides by the rules set forth in these registrar contracts can gain ownership of a domain name for their own use. Due to the hierarchical nature of the PNS, anyone who owns a domain name at any level can configure subdomains for themselves or others as needed. For example, if Alice owns "alice.polka", she can create "acala.alice.polka" as her own address on the acala network, and everything in the subdomain can be configured as she wishes. PNS is deployed in the future on a parallel chain of Kusama and Polkadot. If you use a library, such as the Polkadot.js library, or an end-user application, it will automatically detect the network you are interacting with and deploy using PNS on that network. 

## PNS Architecture Design 

PNS has two main components: **Registry**, and **Parser**. 

### PNS Registry 

The PNS registry consists of a single smart contract that maintains a list of all domains and subdomains, and stores three key pieces of information about each domain: the owner of the domain; the resolver of the domain; and the duration of all records under the domain. The owner of a domain name can be an external account (a user) or a smart contract. A registrar is simply a smart contract that owns a domain name and sends subdomains of that domain name to users who follow certain rules defined in the contract. The owner of the domain name in the PNS registry can: set the resolver and TTL of the domain name; transfer the ownership of the domain name to another address; change the ownership of the subdomain 

### PNS resolver 

The PNS resolver is responsible for the actual process of converting names into addresses. Any contract that implements the relevant standard can be used as a resolver in PNS. For users with simple requirements, such as providing an infrequently changing address for a name, a generic parser implementation is provided. PNS defines one or more methods for each record type (cryptocurrency address, IPFS content hash, etc.) that a PNS parser must implement to provide that type of record. New record types can be defined at any time through the EIP standardization process and do not require changes to the PNS registry or existing resolvers in order to support them. Resolving a domain name in PNS is divided into two processes. First, the registry needs to be asked which resolver is responsible for resolving the domain name. Second, that resolver is asked for the return of the query.

## Application Scenarios 

The PNS integration in DAPP contains several key functions, each of which can be implemented independently. While full PNS integration is ideal, even basic support can be of great benefit to the user. Below, we outline the four levels of PNS integration.PNS parsing is easy to implement and provides high impact for users, while reverse parsing, levels 3 & 4 provide your users with additional functionality that improves the usability of the DApp and the user experience of interacting with the DApp. 

### PNS Parsing 

The first step in supporting PNS in your application is to make your application understand PNS names and accept them. When a user enters a PNS name instead of an address, remember the PNS name, not the currently resolved address. This allows users to update their PNS name and have their DApps that use that name automatically resolve to the new address, just as you would expect your browser to automatically direct you to the new IP address when the site you use changes servers. If the Dapp handles critical resources (such as handling money), it needs to keep track of the address the name resolves to and alert the user when it changes for security purposes. 

### Reverse Resolution 

The second level of PNS integration involves displaying the PNS name where the Dapp currently displays the address. If a user enters a PNS address in the DApp, the name should be retained and displayed to them where the address is normally displayed. If the user enters an address, or if that address is obtained from somewhere else, you can still display the PNS name by reverse parsing. By supporting reverse parsing, you make it easier for users to identify the account they are interacting with by associating it with a short human-readable name rather than a long opaque address. 

### Naming 

The final step in full PNS integration is to facilitate the association of PNS names with resources created or managed by Dapp. This can take two forms. **Name registration** Obtaining a PNS name through Dapp and allowing users to easily register subdomains can provide a simple way for users to name resources created in a DApp. For example, if the DApp is a cryptocurrency wallet, allowing users to easily obtain a PNS domain in the form of theirname.yourwallet.polka allows them to more easily give their name to others. **Name Update** By providing users with an easy way to update the names they own to point to the Dapp's resources, users can assign the names they already own to your DApp's resources. 

### PNS vs. Short Addresses

Since Polkadot addresses are not easy to remember, Polkadot introduced the feature of short addresses, however, the application scenario of PNS is not the same as Polkadot short addresses. The main differences are: Polkadot short addresses are only used for wallets, while PNS can point to contracts; Polkadot short addresses can only uniquely bind a wallet, while PNS can achieve hierarchical management by creating sub-domains. For example, Alice wants to implement a corporate governance DAPP, the company name is Alice_company, Alice recruited some employees, each has a collection wallet, on the PNS, Alice can create a set of employee accounts, such as bob.Alice_company.polka, david.Alice_company.polka, and so on. company.polka, and so on. Alice can send payouts directly to these readable addresses during payroll, without the need to look up a table of addresses; PNS is more free to trade domains, and domains can be traded and auctioned freely on major NFT platforms as an NFT asset.

### Domain name management 

Transferring domain names: Each primary domain name in PNS has an owner. This account or contract is the only account that can make changes to the name of the PNS registry. The owner of a domain name can transfer ownership to any other account.

Creating subdomains: Any domain owner can configure subdomains as needed. This can be done by creating a subdomain and setting its owner to the desired address - this can be the same address as the owner of the parent domain, or any other address.

Setting up a resolver: Before using a newly created domain or subdomain, a resolver address must be set up. This may be required if a newer resolver implementation is available and supports the functionality used. Most commonly, domains are set up to use a "standard" resolver called a public resolver, which provides the common functionality, but anyone can write and deploy their own dedicated resolver.

Updating records: To change the resource to which an address resolves, you must update the record for that name in its resolver. Each parser can specify its own mechanism for updating records, but public parsers and many others implement a standard approach. Some libraries provide the ability to update parser records using this interface. 

Configuring reverse parsing: While "regular" parsing involves mapping from names to addresses, reverse parsing maps from addresses back to names or other metadata. pns supports reverse parsing, allowing applications to display ENS names in place of hexadecimal addresses. Before this can be done, the owner of the address must configure reverse parsing for their address. This is done by calling the claim() method on the reverse parser, which has the special name 'addr.reverse'. This is most commonly done through a user interface, such as the PNS Manager DApp.

Registering and renewing a domain name: When a user first wants to acquire a domain name, they must interact with a registrar. The registrar is the smart contract that owns the domain name and has a clear process for issuing sub-domains. Which registrar a user needs to interact with depends on the domain name they want to obtain; for example, a user who wants a .dot domain name must interact with the .dot registrar. Each registrar defines its own API for domain registration (and, where appropriate, renewal.) Currently, there is no library for interacting with registrars; DApps wishing to do so must use a generic Polkadot library (such as polkadot.js) to interact with the registrar contract. 

## PNS as NFT 

When PNS .polka and .dot registrars are mapped on Ether and become ERC721 compliant non-homogeneous token contracts, this means that .polka and .dot registrars can be transferred just like any other NFT.
