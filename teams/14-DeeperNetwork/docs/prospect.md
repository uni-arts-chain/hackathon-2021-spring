## Market positioning and research

Deeper is positioned to provide everyone with a secure, private and personal data inviolable next-generation Internet infrastructure.

In the personal network security and privacy protection area, the market is currently in a blank stage. As people’s online activities become more frequent and digital assets increase, network security and network privacy have become more and more people’s concerns.

However, the existing personal network security and privacy solutions are not only very expensive, but also have limited functions and are very complicated to use. Deeper Network introduces the Deeper Connect and Deeper Chain by combining network security technology, network sharing technology and blockchain technology. Our products can quickly fill this gap in the market and meet people's needs. Deeper Network's solution mainly includes the following aspects:

1. DPN:
The decentralized privacy network is a P2P distributed bandwidth sharing network that is used to bypass regional censorship and ensure privacy. The network is serverless and distributed; user data will never be recorded, leaked, or invaded. Each node acts as a client and a server at the same time.  Nodes will receive prosperous rewards for their network bandwidth contribution. Compared with the traditional P2P network model, the mining incentive mechanism ensures the stability of the use of the network. At the same time, Deeper's AtomOS network security operating system can also ensure the security of Deeper nodes when they share their own traffic.
1. DWEB:
Deeper aims to provide a next-generation Internet infrastructure where everyone controls their own data sovereignty. Each Deeper Connect device is a server where users can store videos, pictures and texts, and then can distribute and share them with their friends and subscribers through the DPN network.
The data of the content provider and the browsing behavior of the content receiver are encrypted and stored. Users can completely decide who accesses their data and who does not, so that they are no longer controlled and monitored by large Internet companies.
1. DGATE:
Deeper's hardware, Deeper Connect, is a decentralized gateway to Web 3.0. Deeper Connect's users can not only securely access various decentralized network services provided by Deeper Network, but they can also access various third-party dAPP applications without any effort.
For example, the decentralized storage service or DeFi services in the Polkadot  ecosystem. As iPhone provides mobile users with access to Web 2.0, Deeper Connect provides families with access to Web 3.0.

## Current project status

Deeper has now completed a multi-million dollar private equity round of financing, and has built its own software, hardware, blockchain development team and professional marketing team. Deeper has also reached a long-term partnership with a number of hardware manufacturers.

At present, Deeper's project is in the near-mature stage:
1. Deeper's products have achieved a pre-sale of $1 million on Indiegogo. Among the more than 800,000 projects on the Indiegogo platform, fewer than 50 projects can achieve this result
1. Deeper Chain has been selected into the Substrate Builder Program and obtained a web3 grant, the testnet has been launched, and the mainnet will be launched in June 2021
1. Deeper's new generation product, Deeper Connect Nano, has been developed and will be launched on the market soon. Deeper Connect Pico is about to be developed and will support the function of WiFi.
