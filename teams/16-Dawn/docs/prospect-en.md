## Market positioning and research

### Our market positioning

We first is a NFT trading platform and creation, creative platform provides all kinds of images based on the provided API, which expand the circle of fans for the center with celebrity and the image works centered fan coil, trading and celebrity NFT participants to secondary creation of NFT works of art, thus forming fans economic circle. In general, Dawn Network is a fan circle and fan circle platform centered on NFT.

### Market research

At present, the NFT trading market is huge enough and there are many kinds of projects. Opensea, Nifty Gateway, MakersPlace, Rarible, SuperRare and so on are all very good NFT trading platforms, but they are only trading platforms for digital artworks.

NBA Top Shot and Chiliz are trading platforms for digital products based on fan economy. These projects do not provide a platform and function for users to create, nor do they provide the function of forming fan circles for the same lovers and the function of secondary creation.

Chainlink's VRF capability to generate dynamic NFT is currently only available in the Ethereum project - Antasy, which is not yet available in Porca products.

# # the status quo

Our project only started during the hackathons, and we barely ran the project. The resources we have now are limited to three programmers and the contacts of one of them, who is involved in various communities of major projects. He believes that he can quickly complete the promotion of the project.
