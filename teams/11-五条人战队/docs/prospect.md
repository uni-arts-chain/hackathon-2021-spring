# Long-term project planning
## Business plan for the next six months
**1**.In the second phase of the product development plan,multiple incentives are designed for users. In addition to gain rewards by predicting correctly, users also have rewards for predictive mining, staking, predicted leaderboard, liquidity providing and minin, and etc. Also, there are additional rewards for prediction topic creators and community nodes.
**2**.In the second phase of the product development plan.We will integrate cross-chain mechanism, we're ready to become a para-chain of Polkadot.At present, the cross-chain will be concentrated between the parachains, the purpose is to make more other parachain assets can participate as the settlement currency of the forecast proposal.In addition, market-driven mining will seek to interact with other projects.
**3**.In the third phase of the product development plan.The platform will open up community autonomous nodes, and reporting and supervision mechanisms. Each user will be able to become a governance node by staking governance tokens. The governance node can upload the results and share the revenue from withdrawal fee. The governance node is authorized to upload results and accept the supervision of the entire network. When the result submitted by the node is different from reality, any user can initiate a report through pledge, the reported person will be punished, and the reporter will be rewarded.
**4**.In the third phase of the product development plan.Optimize an easier-to-use oracle. In order to encourage more non tech-savvy users to explore the oracle, we will develop a graphical operation interface for the common users to upload results through the oracle.
**5**.In the third phase of the product development plan.Add the governance voting pool of the parameters and development of the platform itself. The range of voting concludes the settings of some parameters of the platform, future revisions, iterative upgrades of the platform, such as adding new features.
**6**.In the fourth phase of the product development plan, a more designated and user-friendly dashboard will be added to display platform statistics.
**7**.In the fourth phase of the product development plan, More than simple prediction, it is a way for actively socialize and interact with passion. Users will be able to discuss topics by predicting topics, and join a forum-style communication system, with social functions such as friends’ group and group chats.

## Market positioning and research
X predict Market plans to build the parachain on Polkadot network. Our main focus in the early stage of development lies in the development and upgrade in the test chain.X predict Market will play an important role in the Polkadot network as prediction market, an integration prediction platform including event prediction, community governance, cross-chain, market incentive as well as social system.Concerning the settlement currency in prediction market, X predict Market will give priority to the tokens of Polkadot ecosystem. Besides, we will seek interaction with other projects in terms of the market incentive mining. For example, tokens of a certain project can be chosen as settlement currency of a certain popular topic of X predict Market. In addition to the prediction mining, users can share the transaction fee by providing liquidity, obtained from which the LP token can be used for yield farm.
- **Target audience**
  - The target audience of our project is based on users interested in predicting events, but can be extended to the corresponding types of interested users according to the specific types of prediction topics,For instance, price prediction of certain DEFI project can be extended to users in DEFI area, and even focus on users of the project itsel;Another example, the prediction of the presidential election can appeal to those who have not been exposed to digital currencies, who simply want to participate in the pre-predictions of the presidential election, who are fans of a certain president or someone who wants to make a profit through gaming in addition to users who are interested in the prediction if-self.
- **Use case**
  - Our project enables the users to hedge their risks. For instance, farmers in a certain area can hedge their risk of drought by predicting rainfall. If the rainfall is of abundance, a bumper crop is expected, if not, the farmers can receive their hedge profit. 
  - Our project is applicable in consumer preferences investigation.For example, prediction of the sales volume of a certain two competing products in a certain quarter. The competing product can refer to a certain car, food, cosmetics, etc. with public sales statistics (for example, a listed company with quarterly reports), which can guarantee the final result. Ex Ante prediction can gain insight to people’s satisfaction and confidence in different competing products in advance, thereby knowing which products are more popular with consumers, and improving existing products to meet consumer preferences.
  - Our project is also suitable for the tendency of political elections investigation. For instance, in the US presidential election, the prediction platform can be used to gain insight of people's authentic thoughts on which candidate people are more biased towards.
  - For example, our project can be adapted to truth investigation.The true cause of a mystery case may only be known to a few, and then people can suggest whether someone is willing to disclose the truth, or directly select a group of suspects as an option, and those who know the truth will be motivated by the market to reveal the truth with evidence. After the recognition of all, the proof not only restores the truth to the world, but also gains profit out of it, and people can stay anonymous for safety concerns.
  - Our project also applies to the investigation of market price trends. Like predicting the price of a certain city or even a specific real estate, or predicting how much the highest price of BTC can reach in a certain period of time, revealing people's true expectations of this type of asset.
  - The prediction topics of our project are issued from users' spontaneous discussions, which is featured with great diversification. Evolution is expected with the continuous use case discovery by users. The use case above are merely just some possible examples.
  - Compared with Option Room in the Polkadot ecology, it has no prediction product available yet. From its disclosed content, compared with X predict Market, it lacks flexibility and does not operate Automatic market maker based on AMM; Lack of incentives, it is not featured with our prediction mining, LP mining, creator rewards, prediction rank list and other market incentives; lack of sociability, we will create a prediction topics driven Community interaction forum where users can interact with each other.
  - Compared with projects outside of Polkadot ecology. FTX is a centralized project, which is at the risk of being operated in the dark by the platform and legal issue; Prosper is based on Binance Chain, with only automatically generated short-term price forecasts, and the range of audience is narrow; Omen is not based on Polkadot, it lacks the diversity of cross-chain asset participation, and lacks diversified incentives and sociality;Polymarket is short of community governance and reporting and supervision mechanisms;The homogeneous topic of Catnip cannot even be independently created by users, as well as the absence of community governance and incentives; Augur is the order-book type, not as flexible and liquidity abundant as AMM's automatic market making, and lacks the participation of cross-chain assets and market incentives.


# 项目远期规划
## 未来六个月的商业规划
**1**.在产品开发计划的第二阶段，为用户设计了多种激励措施。除了通过正确的预测获得奖励外，用户还可以获得预测性采矿，质押，预测排行榜，流动性提供和交易等方面的奖励。此外，预测主题创建者和社区节点还有其他奖励。
**2**.在产品开发计划的第二阶段，我们将整合跨链机制，准备成为Polkadot的准链，目前，跨链将集中在准链之间，目的是以使更多其他平行链资产可以作为预测提案的结算货币。此外，以市场为导向的采矿业将寻求与其他项目进行互动。
**3**.在产品开发计划的第三阶段，该平台将开放社区自治节点，并建立报告和监督机制。每个用户都可以通过抵押治理令牌来成为治理节点。治理节点可以上载结果并共享取款费收入。治理节点有权上传结果并接受整个网络的监督。当节点提交的结果与实际不符时，任何用户都可以通过质押发起举报，举报者将受到处罚，举报者将得到奖励。
**4**.在产品开发计划的第三阶段中，优化易于使用的预言家。为了鼓励更多不懂技术的用户探索oracle，我们将开发一个图形化的操作界面，供普通用户通过oracle上传结果。
**5**.在产品开发计划的第三阶段，添加参数的治理投票池和平台本身的开发。投票范围包括平台某些参数的设置，将来的修订，平台的迭代升级（例如添加新功能）。
**6**.在产品开发计划的第四阶段，将添加一个更具指定性和用户友好性的仪表板以显示平台统计信息。
**7**.在产品开发计划的第四阶段，不仅仅是简单的预测，它是一种积极地社交和充满激情的互动方式。用户将能够通过预测主题来讨论主题，并加入具有社交功能（例如朋友的小组聊天和小组聊天）的论坛式通信系统。

## 市场定位及调研
X predict Market生态系统的市场
X predict Market计划在Polkadot网络上构建平行链。 我们在开发初期的主要重点在于测试链的开发和升级.X predict Market将在Polkadot网络中扮演重要角色，作为预测市场，这是一个集成预测平台，包括事件预测，社区治理，跨链 关于预测市场中的结算货币，X predict Market将优先考虑Polkadot生态系统的代币。 此外，我们将在市场激励挖掘方面寻求与其他项目的互动。 例如，可以选择某个项目的代币作为X predict Market某个热门话题的结算货币。 除了预测挖掘之外，用户还可以通过提供流动性来共享交易费用，从中获得的流动性可以将LP令牌用于收益农场。
- **目标观众**
  - 我们项目的目标受众是基于对事件进行预测的用户，但是可以根据特定的预测主题类型扩展到感兴趣的用户的相应类型，例如，某些DEFI项目的价格预测可以扩展到以下领域的用户： DEFI领域，甚至关注项目本身的用户；另一个示例，总统选举的预测可以吸引那些尚未接触过数字货币的人，他们只是想参加总统选举的预测，除了对预测if-self感兴趣的用户之外，他们还是某位总裁的粉丝或想要通过游戏获利的人。
- **用例**
  - 我们的项目使用户能够规避风险。例如，某个地区的农民可以通过预测降雨量来抵御干旱的风险。如果雨量充沛，则预计将获得丰收，否则，农民将获得套期保值利润。
我们的项目适用于消费者喜好调查，例如，预测某个季度中某些两种竞争产品的销量。竞争产品可以指具有公开销售统计信息的某些汽车，食品，化妆品等（例如，具有季度报告的上市公司），这可以保证最终结果。事前预测可以提前洞悉人们对不同竞争产品的满意度和信心，从而了解哪些产品在消费者中更受欢迎，并改进现有产品以满足消费者的喜好。
  - 我们的项目也适合于政治选举调查的趋势。例如，在美国总统大选中，可以使用预测平台来了解人们对候选人的偏见的真实想法。
  - 例如，我们的项目可以适应真相调查，只有几个人知道一个神秘案件的真正原因，然后人们才能建议有人愿意透露真相，还是直接选择一组犯罪嫌疑人作为犯罪嫌疑人。选择权，那些知道真相的人会受到市场的激励，以用证据揭示真相。在所有人的认可之后，证明不仅可以将真相还原为世界，而且还可以从中获利，并且人们可以出于安全考虑而保持匿名。
  - 我们的项目也适用于市场价格趋势的调查。例如，预测某个城市甚至某个房地产的价格，或者预测BTC的最高价格在特定时期内可以达到多少，就可以揭示人们对此类资产的真实期望。
  - 我们项目的预测主题是通过用户的自发讨论发布的，具有很大的多样性。随着用户不断发现用例，预计会不断发展。上面的用例仅仅是一些可能的示例。
  - 与Polkadot生态中的Option Room相比，它尚没有可用的预测产品。从其公开的内容来看，与X predict Market相比，它缺乏灵活性，并且没有运营基于AMM的自动做市商；缺乏激励措施，我们的预测挖掘，有限合伙人挖掘，创造者奖励，预测排名列表和其他市场激励措施并未提供此功能；缺乏社交性，我们将创建一个由社区预测论坛驱动的预测主题，用户可以在其中进行交互。
  - 与Polkadot生态之外的项目进行了比较。 FTX是一个集中项目，存在平台和法律问题在黑暗中进行操作的风险； Prosper基于Binance Chain，仅自动生成短期价格预测，受众范围狭窄； Omen并非基于Polkadot，它缺乏跨链资产参与的多样性，缺乏多元化的激励机制和社会性; Polymarket缺乏社区治理以及报告和监督机制; Catnip的同类主题甚至不能由用户独立创建，以及缺乏社区治理和激励措施； Augur是订单类型，不像AMM的自动做市那样灵活和充裕，并且缺乏跨链资产和市场激励机制的参与。
