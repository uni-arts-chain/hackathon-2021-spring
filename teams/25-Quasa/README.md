CRAB DEX

Decentralized Cryptocurrency Derivatives Exchange



Overview

With the fast development of block-chain technology and digital currency, cryptocurrency derivatives have become more and more popular among the communities. However, trading through CEX facing multiple risks such as regulation, malicious acts, hacker attacks, etc. CRAB DEX aims to provide traders a much safer, more reliable, and easy to use trading platform with the following advantages:

Full Decentralization: All indexing price, margin deposits and trading are fully on chain. This design insures the accuracy of the index and the safety of the assets while excludes any possibilities of malicious acts that come from the CEX team (Artificial Price Spikes, Front Running, etc.).

HMM (Holding is Market Making): Holder serves both roles as a trader and liquidity provider. All margins from the users will be deposited into the Liquidity Pool to provide liquidity for the platform. The innovative price discovery function optimizes capital efficiency.

No Impermanent Loss: All liquidity on the platform comes from the position holders. It is protected by a multi-layer mechanism. The loss will be covered by selling newly minted governance tokens. The exchange supports long & short positions, holders can hedge the price fluctuation by holding positions for both directions. Thus, holders can claim the LP rewards with minimized risks.

Various Index: Besides the BTC, ETH, and other cryptocurrencies’ price indexes, the exchange will add indexes underlying Gold, Stocks, etc. in the future.

Margin Deposits Support Multi-Asset: The exchange will be using USDT as margin in the early stage, and more assets will be introduced to the exchange through cross-chain technologies in the future.

The exchange will be issuing two tokens, the governance token will be used to incentivize the growth of the ecosystem and the governance of the exchange. Users can earn platform tokens by holding positions to provide liquidity for the exchange. Users can also stake platform tokens to claim governance tokens for voting and other rights.
