# Market position and survey

#### Our position

As we move toward the fully decentralized future imagined by the creators of Web 3.0, we uncover the centralized artefacts of Web 2.0 on which we unfortunately still rely. Apron Labs has created the Apron Network to address and radically transform the foundational layer of this future by providing a decentralized infrastructure service network for DApp developers.



#### Market survey

Many projects have attempted to solve the issues  of blockchain infrastructure services, contributing  both centralized and decentralized solutions.

Infura provides API services for developers by building its own Ethereum and IPFS nodes, allowing developers to access Ethereum and IPFS node data through API services.

NOWNodes operates in a similar fashion to Infura, but provides more blockchain network API services. It claims to have provided 45 chain API services.

API3 constructed a public blockchain that provides an oracle network, governed in a  DAO structure with Kleros. By submitting an oracle to the data source provider, API3 builds the oracle network and provides cross-blockchain aggregation data for DApp.

BitQuery is a blockchain data engine that provides the data API on-chain to users by aggregating the blockchain data, BitQuery also provides simple data analysis capabilities and GraphQL API on the blockchain.

The Graph proposes a novel Ethereum and IPFS on-chain service index protocol. By using SubGraph’s definition, the index information is retrieved and established in the smart contract, and the GraphQL API is served for users to obtain the data information corresponding to the DApp.

Apron Network is the only one who can provide the underlayer for almost all infrastructures.
