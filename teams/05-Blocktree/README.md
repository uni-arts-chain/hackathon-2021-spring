# Blocktree

## Team Info

Shopbring is developed by the blocktree team, the team github: https://github.com/blocktree/.

Blocktree sprouted in December 2016. It was just a loose blockchain interest research group at the beginning, with members from developers in different fields. In the process of researching the blockchain technology, we found that the upgrade and development of the blockchain will either hard fork (risk of splitting) or re-engage the independent development of the main-chain. The respective ecological resources of the blockchain cannot be integrated and developed, and a complete decentralized system cannot be realized. So we put forward the concept of blocktree, we believe that the blockchain will eventually need to be developed into a blocktree structure in order to achieve a complete decentralized system.

In 2018, blocktree started the research and development of the openwallet framework, redefining a wallet system model compatible with multiple blockchains.

In 2019, the development of the openwallet framework was completed, and the openwallet developer platform was implemented based on the framework, and multiple applications were implemented at the same time, such as: personal decentralized wallet App, enterprise-level digital asset management system, multi-chain multi-signature wallet system. Up to today, the openwallet framework has integrated 60+ blockchain technologies, which greatly reduces the cost of developers and users.

In 2020, blocktree began to study the Polkadot ecosystem and found that Polkadot's understanding of the blockchain and pursuit of goals are consistent with blocktree.

## Project Structure

In src folder:

- `shopbring` is the blockchain node based Substrate. You can interact it with [polkadot.js.org/apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/).
- `shopbring-server` is the off-chain order system based NodeJS.
- `shopbring-app` is the web app based polkadot-js/api, for Polkadot wallet users.
