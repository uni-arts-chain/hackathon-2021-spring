# Prospect

## Business plan for the next 6 months

1. Our team will complete Shopbring's program development in accordance with the system design specifications within 6 months, and release the mainnet before September 2021.
1. In the seed round stage, we will privately raise DOT or KSM as development funds to the Polkadot community, and distribute native tokens to seed round investors when the mainnet is created.
1. Connect to Polkadot/Kusama through bridges, parachains, parathreads, etc., to support multiple asset shopping.
1. Adapt to more e-commerce platforms in different regions to meet the needs of cryptocurrency shopping in different regions.
1. Establish a strategic cooperation with the DeFi project of the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem to achieve platform profitability and support the value of native tokens.

## Market positioning

Shopbring meets the needs of two types of people:

* People who are attracted by the high returns of DeFi and want to invest a little money to participate in DeFi, but have no experience in cryptocurrency trading.
* People who don't want to frequently exchange fiat currencies in the OTC market, but want to directly use cryptocurrency for shopping, and can flexibly participate in DeFi.

## Existing resources and operations

We currently have an experienced development team, including: Substrate engineers, front-end engineers, back-end engineers, cryptographic algorithm engineers, etc.

Because the development of the project has not yet been completed, there is no actual operating situation for the time being.
