## Long-term planning

 We have implemented a credit delegation lending contract and would like to make it available on the Patract Store and other smart contract parachains for everyone to use.

* Supporting additional pools of funds, such as stable coins in the polkadot.
* Integration into a DAO project to facilitate user donations.
* The introduction of Openlaw, combined with off-chain contracts, allows for un-collateralized lending between institutionsï¼›
* The introduction of backing NFTs as collateral for lending. Now, the NFT boom has caused some assets to lose liquidity and we want to get that liquidity back.
