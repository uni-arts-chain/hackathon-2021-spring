Sublend is a lending contract, based on the Substrate ink! ï¼Œproject adopts a pool model design, offering both collateralized lending and un-collateralized lending.

* For collateralized lending, users need to first deposit the crypto assets they own as collateral in the corresponding pool, and then lend other crypto assets they need from the pool. Crypto assets also support NFTs as collateral, increasing liquidity in the NFT market.
* For un-collateralized lending, users can borrow from a corresponding pool without collateralizing
