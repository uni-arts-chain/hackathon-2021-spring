### SubLend

Sublend is a lending contract module based on Substrate ink!, which can be deployed to all parachains that support WASM contracts.

By providing a credit-delegete loan, it is different from the over-collateralized loan model, which is similar to the combination of spend-first-pay-later and add-on pay, and improves the utilization rate of reserve funds.

At the same time, it provides stable rate loans to meet the needs of some traditional financial institutions for predictable financial expenditures. It can effectively solve the problem of liquidity of reserves and the problem of unpredictable expenditure in the DeFi lending protocol.

Sublend 是基于 Substrate ink! 实现的借贷合约模块，可以部署到所有支持 WASM 合约的平行链。

通过提供一种信用委托式的贷款，区别于超额抵押借贷模式，类似于白条和亲密付的结合体，提高储备资金的利用率。

同时提供固定利率贷款，满足一些传统金融机构对可预测财务支出的需求。可有效解决 DeFi 借贷协议中储备金流动性的问题和财务支出不可预测的问题。
