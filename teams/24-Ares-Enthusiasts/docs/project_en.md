###Project introduction

The members of Ares team were all senior developers engaged in the development of public chain and alliance chain, as well as the research of defi application and cross chain. Before Ares, they had done a lot of practice in Ethereum and cosmos. After discovering the substrate framework, they turned to Boca ecology one after another. Using the substrate framework, they can quickly build the basic components needed by the oracle,
Fred, CEO of Ares, is from New Zealand, where the first defi ACALA in Boca was born. Ares coo Zamir is from Germany.
From our technical background, we can see that we have enough experience in the underlying technology to realize all the functions of Ares and bring unprecedented innovation to the defi infrastructure.

Ares protocol is a decentralized cross link Oracle service protocol of Boca ecology. It is a new generation Oracle service protocol that implements verification on the data link, and it is the first to open up a compensation channel for data users who suffer business losses due to using Oracle data. As an infrastructure builder connecting the real world and the blockchain network, facing the grand vision of the Web3.0 era, it provides secure and reliable data services for the development of Wan chain interconnection and digital economy.



###How does ares avoid the problems of oracle

At present, Oracle mainly has the following problems: high degree of centralization, slow data response, high handling charge and easy to attack.

The Oracle machines in Ethereum ecology are faced with the problem of high gas fee, which leads to the inability to carry complex applications on the chain, which makes it impossible to add cryptography related algorithms to ensure the security of data on the chain. Without the blessing of algorithms, it is easy to be attacked by hackers. In addition, the frequency of submitting price updates is not too high, which can not guarantee the real-time performance of data. Ethereum produces a lot of problems The out of state band Oracle only implements the bidding node management similar to dpos, which can't manage a large number of bidding nodes and bring random bidding node management.

Ares is built on the basis of substance. It uses babe consensus to ensure the anonymity of the quotation node, so that the evil nodes can not reach collusion, tamper with the price and decentralize the quotation node. It uses Boca's unique offchain Worker ensures that the data under the chain can be submitted to the chain safely and credibly. NPOs is used to ensure the decentralization of nodes and the rewards brought by maintaining the network. Babe consensus's powerful block out speed ensures the real-time submission of prices. Chain governance is used to punish malicious bidding nodes. Challengers are rewarded to achieve the authenticity and reliability of data on the chain.



###In order to open up a compensation channel for data users who suffer from business losses due to data pre-processing, I would like to ask what are ares's considerations for making such a commitment?

With the development and prosperity of open finance, the role of Oracle, which provides data services for defi, has been more and more reflected. The importance of Oracle as the underlying infrastructure of the blockchain has been verified in the defi attacks,
A large number of defi protocols have been attacked, and many insurance protocols have become popular with defi, some of which are asset related insurance. If the profi protocol wants to use Oracle, the first thing to consider is asset security.


There are several reasons for opening up compensation channels

* First of all, it is a kind of self-confidence to ensure the security and credibility of the data after multi-layer verification mechanism on the Ares network chain
* Secondly, in order to improve and optimize the service of Oracle, Oracle should not just provide data service, we provide more service guarantee for data demanders
* The third is that ares has its own Treasury, through which the data demanders can reduce their worries when using the Oracle service of Ares


Through the compensation channel, Ares enables the access of defi without worries. If the price problem causes losses, Ares will release part of the funds from the Treasury to protect the interests of defi. In the future, Ares will introduce insurance protocol to upgrade the security of defi to the level of automation and community governance, and make a more secure Oracle architecture.



### What are the advantages of Ares over other Oracle machines

At present, Oracle mainly has the following problems: high degree of centralization, slow data response, high handling charge and easy to attack.

Ares has the following advantages

**Openness**

As long as there is a certain amount of pledge, Ares can become the aggregator node of Ares network, so as to ensure the universality and distributed characteristics of data sources.

**Fairness**
* Ares network randomly selects aggregator nodes to provide data through VRF, which effectively ensures the fairness and decentralization between nodes. Any node may be randomly selected as a data provider. The Ares network will accumulate the reputation value for each node, and the reputation value can be used as an important reference index for the members of the Governance Committee.
* Ares network is the first compensation scheme. When data demanders suffer business losses by using the data provided by the Ares network through multi-layer security mechanism verification, they can initiate a proposal to the Ares Treasury to apply for certain compensation. After the proposal is approved by the Governance Committee, the compensation will be allocated to the data demanders. This adds another service guarantee to data demanders.



**Security**

* Aggregating multiple data sources is conducive to removing abnormal data and weighted average other data. When the aggregation chain submits the price to the chain, it will aggregate on the chain to prevent individual aggregators from doing evil, so as to ensure the authenticity and validity of the data.
The most obvious example is that hackers deliberately affect the asset price on DEX to influence the oracle to provide this price to the defi loan agreement to achieve the purpose of arbitrage. Ares network has long removed this abnormal price when aggregating multiple distributed data sources, thus avoiding the possibility of such attacks.
* When the selected aggregator node provides data, any node can challenge by paying a certain gas to question the authenticity and validity of its data, and the Arbitration Commission will deal with the challenger's query in time. The successful challenge will be rewarded, otherwise it will be punished and the gas will be lost. In addition, the aggregation function of Ares network adds another layer of protection to the data source. In this way, under the supervision of all nodes and networks, the data provided by nodes are fully guaranteed to be true and effective.



**Real time**

Ares verifies and shares the security consensus of the Boca network on the data link to ensure that the data demander can receive the feedback results in real time and quickly after sending the request.
