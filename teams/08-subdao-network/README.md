# About
SubDAO is a DAO infrastructure based on Polkadot, where any decentralized organization is allowed to conveniently create and manage a DAO. SubDAO does not only connect DAO with DApps to realize DAO’s cross-chain management, but also bridges Web 2.0 and Web 3.0. With the Web 2.0 middleware provided by SubDAO, users can conduct DAO governance directly on traditional social media platforms. Developers are able to quickly integrate DAO governance capacities with their apps on blockchain, webpage, and mobile. Meanwhile, SubDAO’s templates and ecosystem tools will realize crypto assets management, credit lending and borrowing, real-time communication, and other decentralized functions for DAO.
