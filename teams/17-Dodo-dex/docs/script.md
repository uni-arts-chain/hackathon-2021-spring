## Note

We are EVM-compatible Defi protocol, so our src folders are based on truffle using Solidity, and we temporarily choose [moonbeam](https://moonbeam.network/) as parachain to participate this hackthon. And also will deploy on Acala、Clover、Plasm in few weeks. 

We will deploy our own moonbeam node in the next few days, which is fully compatible with Polkadot's parachain. So today, We will choose kovan network to show you our prodcuts.
