## Market Position

DODO: centuplicated tokens' cradle

- Excellent trading experience
- All-inclusive assetss
- Good choice to issue assets

- The Proactive Market Making (PMM) algorithm was developed entirely in-house and is an elegant, on-chain generalization of orderbook trading. It is adapted and optimized for operations on the blockchain and has proven itself to be highly performant and capital-efficient (as its high volume/TVL ratio can attest) with many innovative, flexible use cases in market making.
- DODO provides the ability to issue new assets at the lowest cost and create highly liquid capital pools through Crowdpooling. There are no restrictions on the initial price nor the ratio of funds and tokens supplied.
- DODO supports efficient on-chain professional market making. Any project owner, market maker, or retail investor can comprehensively control and execute their market making strategies in an efficient, flexible manner, by adjusting parameters such as market mid-price, liquidity depth, and spread. This liquidity on DODO can also be shared and is composable with other on-chain smart contracts.
- DODO is both a DEX and an aggregator; It has its own liquidity pools and also supports trading between any two tokens available on the market
- The DODO token economics model introduces a membership system and a fee sharing mechanism. In addition to its governance functions, DODO gives holders trading fee discounts and IDO participation allocations. The systemâ€™s vDODO proof-of-membership tokens entitle holders to trading fee dividends and membership rewards, as well as the DODO holder benefits.
