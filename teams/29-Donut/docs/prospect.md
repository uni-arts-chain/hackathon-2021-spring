# Donut project planning

## Market positioning

Donut is committed to helping founders of non-technical communities to tokenize their content websites/applications and online communities so as to build their digital communities.

By using the modular components provided by Donut, non-technical community founders can use community tokens to reward community construction and social interaction with simple configurations, and the innumerable individuals who have made subjective contributions to the community will be provided with cryptocurrency as rewards. Donut modular components include SCO fundraising (Staking Coin Offering),  NFT content, community of DeFi, etc.

## Status of operation

Having more than two years of developmental experiences, Donut has developed Aksai baas toolset, WhereIN DApp (picture community), Ooops DApp (local social media), and Nutbox website (blog) based on the Steem blockchain. Donut has the ability to quickly create a blockchain-based public content platform in the form of websites, applications, applets, etc. for online communities. This allows communities with content websites/applications to access the blockchain rapidly.

Donut has fully contacted the communities of interests and communities of the industries and held the 2019 ChengDu Community Conference with WorkFace.

Donut is now working with Nutbox to use the Staking Economy model of the PoS chain to explore a new funding model (Staking Coin Offering) for the community. Not only can this financing method ensure the safety of community users' original assets (using the PoS mechanism to pledge on the PoS chain), but it can also raise funds for community funds.

Through the efforts of the Donut team, WhereIN is now the public chain DApp NO.07 in the social category, and it is also the Steem blockchain 21 super node. Nutbox combined the Steem and Tron blockchains to build the Peanut community. It realized the distribution of PEANUT by pledging STEEM and liquidity mining, which became the Steem blockchain NO.02 SP delegated community.

## Business planning

Next, Donut will continue to work with Nutbox to explore the "one-click automatic" configuration of SCO funding, community of DeFi and other modules for the community. It is expected to be launched in May.

Donut is also building "Steem + NFT", which will bring greater returns to high-quality creators by integrating public content with NFT. This module is expected to be launched in April.

In June, Donut will unite the Chengdu community so as to build its digital community for some content communities and deploy the community of DeFi, NFT and other modules gradually.

From July to August, Donut plans to participate in the Parachain slot auction to gain the ability to connect with the Polkadot ecological project. Ideally, Donut modular components will be launched on Donut parachain, allowing the community to configure SCO fundraising, community of DeFi, NFT and other modules easily.

In September, Donut will be fully introduced to the market.

# Donut项目规划

## 市场定位

Donut致力于帮助非技术社区创始人将其内容网站/应用程序、在线社区通证化，构建其数字化社区。

通过Donut提供的模块化组件，非技术社区创始人简单配置，就能够使用社区通证奖励社区建设和社交互动，为无数对社区做出主观贡献的个人提供加密货币的回报。Donut模块化组件包括SCO筹资（Staking Coin Offering)、内容NFT、社区DeFi等。

## 运营现状

经历过去两年多的发展，Donut已基于Steem区块链开发了Aksai baas工具集、WhereIN DApp（图片社区）、Ooops DApp（本地社交媒体）、Nutbox网站（博客）。Donut有能力快速为在线社区创建网站、应用程序、小程序等形式的、基于区块链的公共内容平台，让拥有内容网站/应用程序的社区快速接入区块链。

Donut还与兴趣社群、行业社群进行了充分接触，与WorkFace一道举办了2019成都社群大会。

Donut正在与Nutbox一道，利用PoS链的Staking Economy模型，为社区探索一条新的筹资模型（Staking Coin Offering）。这种筹资方式既能保护社区用户原始资产的安全（利用PoS机制，质押在PoS链上），又能为社区基金筹集资金。

通过Donut团队的努力，WhereIN现为公有链社交类DApp NO.07，亦为Steem区块链21超级节点。Nutbox结合Steem和Tron区块链，构建了Peanut社区，为其实现了质押STEEM分发PEANUT、流动性挖矿，成为Steem区块链 NO.02 SP代理社区。

## 商业规划

接下来，Donut将继续与Nutbox一道，探索为社区“一键自动”配置 SCO筹资、社区DeFi等模块。预计将于5月上线。

Donut亦正在构建“Steem + NFT”，通过将创作者生产的公共内容与NFT进行融合，为优质创作者带来更丰富的回报。预计此模块将于4月上线。

6月，Donut将联合成都社群，为部分内容社群构建其数字化社区，并逐步配置社区DeFi、NFT等模块。

7-8月，Donut计划参与平行链插槽拍卖，获得与Polkadot生态项目连接的能力。理想情况下，届时将在Donut parachain上线Donut模块化组件，让社区能够轻松配置 SCO筹资、社区DeFi、NFT等模块。

9月，Donut全面推向市场。
