# Future Plan

In the upcoming 6 months, we would like to restructure the team, continue the development to enhance the Web3Games ecosystem and start the business development to attract game developers.

## Team Formation

Troughout the hackathon, we've gathered a great team of contract developer, blockchain developer, UIUX designers and project manager. We would like to form an official organisation to make this project a long-term one and contribute more to complete this ecosystem for game developers.

## Technical Development

We've drafted the blueprint for this project and would like to continue the development part, releasing the SDK needed and game engine integrations. On the other hand, we also want to kick start more blockchain game projects utlitise our frameworks as showcases to game developers.

## Business Development

We started to approach to mobile game companies in the hackathon and we already got some synergies about how we can work together. We would like to put more resource on this part and getting more opportunties to work with great game developers.



# Market Positioning

In the blockchain world, NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens) is the new big trend. In fact, we've been using digital assets since computer games were invented. All of us tried to make achievements, get game weapons and badges inside the computer games. People are willing to pay for digital game weapons, customs, badges in order for them to enjoy playing the games. The Worldâ€™s 2.7 Billion Gamers Will Spend $159.3 Billion on Games in 2020. The Market Will Surpass $200 Billion by 2023. We would like to make the games connected by blockchain. We can see there are great potential for NFT to work with computer games, which is the blockchain game base. That's why we want to kickstart the project Web3Games.
